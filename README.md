# Secured Data Warehouse On-premisses Data Ingestion Blueprint

[FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) | [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

This repository contains Terraform configuration modules that allow Google Cloud customers to import data from an on-premises environment or another cloud into a Secured [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) warehouse.
This blueprint provides an opinionated architecture and an example on how to:

- Encrypt data located outside of Google Cloud and import it into BigQuery using the [Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink) library.
- Configure VPC Service Controls to secure the data pipeline and access to confidential data.
- Configure separation of duties for personas (Google Groups).
- Set up appropriate security controls (Organization Policies) and Google Cloud Logging to help protect confidential data.
- Use data classification, Data Catalog policy tags, dynamic data masking, and column-level encryption to restrict access to specific columns in the BigQuery data warehouse.

## Disclaimer

When using this blueprint, it is important to understand how you manage [separation of duties](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/separation-of-duties. We recommend you remove all primitive `owner` roles in the projects used as inputs for the blueprint main module. The blueprint itself does not need any primitive owner roles for correct operations.
The Blueprint does not proactively remove any pre-existing owner role assignments from pre-existing projects in your organization, as we wonâ€™t know your intent for or dependency on these role assignments in your pre-existing workloads. The pre-existing presence of these roles does expand the attack and risk surface of the resulting deployment. Therefore, we highly recommend you review your use of owner roles in these pre-existing cases and see if you can eliminate them to improve your resulting security posture.

You can check the current situation of your project with either of the following methods:

- Using [Security Health Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-vulnerabilities-findings#security-health-analytics-detectors) (SHA), checking the [KMS vulnerability findings](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-vulnerabilities-findings#kms-findings), for the Detector `KMS_PROJECT_HAS_OWNER`.
  - You can search for the SHA findings with category `KMS_PROJECT_HAS_OWNER` in the Security Command Center in the  Google Cloud Console.
- You can also use Cloud Asset Inventory [search-all-iam-policies](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#search_policies) `gcloud` command doing a [Query by role](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#examples_query_by_role) to search for owner of the project.

See the [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) for additional good practices.

**Note:** There are three inputs related to GCP Locations in the module:

- `pubsub_resource_location`: is used to define which GCP location will be used to [Restrict Pub/Sub resource locations](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/resource-location-restriction). This policy offers a way to ensure that messages published to a topic are never persisted outside of a Google Cloud regions you specify, regardless of where the publish requests originate. **Zones or multi-region locations are not supported**.
- `location`: is used to define which GCP region will be used for all other resources created: [Cloud Storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations), [BigQuery datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations), and [Cloud KMS key rings](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations). **Multi-region locations are supported**.
- `trusted_locations`: is a list of locations that are used to set an [Organization Policy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations#location_types) that restricts the GCP locations that can be used in the projects of the Secured Data Warehouse. Both `pubsub_resource_location` and `location` must respect this restriction.

A Functional example, deploying the module, the required infrastructure needed by the module,
and data to be ingested is included in the [examples](./examples/) directory.

Additional information related to the inputs and outputs of the module are detailed in the following section.

## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for using this blueprint.

**Note:** Please see the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) regarding **project owners** before creating projects.

### Software

The following dependencies must be available:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) version 357.0.0 or later
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.13.7 or later
- [Terraform Provider for GCP](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google) version 4.61 or later
- [Terraform Provider for GCP Beta](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google-beta) version 4.61 or later

### Security Groups

Provide the following groups for separation of duty.
Each group will be granted roles to perform their tasks.
Add users to the appropriate groups as needed.

- **Data Engineer group**: Google Cloud IAM group that sets up and maintains the data pipeline and warehouse.
- **Data Analyst group**: Google Cloud IAM group that analyzes the data in the warehouse.
- **Security Analyst group**: Google Cloud IAM group that monitors and responds to security incidents.
- **Network Administrator group**: Google Cloud IAM group that reviews network configuration. Typically, this includes members of the networking team.
- **Security Administrator group**: Google Cloud IAM group that administers security configurations in the organization(org policies, KMS, VPC service perimeter).
- **Encrypted Data Reader Group**: Google Cloud IAM group that analyzes encrypted data.
- **Plain Text Reader Group**: Google Cloud IAM group that analyzes plaintext reader.

Groups can be created in the Google [Workspace Admin Console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9400082?hl=en), in the Google [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/groups-in-cloud-console), or using gcloud identity [groups create](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/identity/groups/create) command.

**Note 1:** Groups **Data Engineer** and **Data Analyst** are granted the role "Service Account User" on the [Dataflow controller](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/security-and-permissions#specifying_a_user-managed_controller_service_account) service account, the one in the `dataflow_controller_service_account_email` output.
This is required to be able to run dataflow jobs in the Data Ingestion project.

See the [Dataflow Jobs Deployment](./docs/deploying_dataflow_jobs.md) documentation for additional information on deploying Dataflow Jobs.

**Note 2:** The group **Plain Text Reader Group** is the only group tha should be granted access to the KMS keys used to encrypt the data.

### Service Account

To provision the resources of this module, you must create a privileged service account, where the service account key cannot be created.

[IAM module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-iam) in combination to provision.
These modules can be used to provision a service account with the necessary roles applied.

The user who uses this service account must be granted the [IAM roles necessary to impersonate](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-permissions) the service account.
